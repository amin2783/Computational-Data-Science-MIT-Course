There are many ways to come up with a better function. Sometimes we just guess what a better function is. However, the best way to come up with a better function is to use our knowledge of the data and physics. \n", "\n", "When we expand the range of redshifts, what we are doing is looking at a larger range of the universe. That means that we need to come up with a better model of the universe. Fortunately, in this case there has been a lot of work towards building a better model of the universe. This work has led us to the so called Friedmann equations for the expansion of the universe. \n", "\n", "We can write the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations\" target=\"_blank\">Friedmann equations</a> in terms of the Hubble constant $h$ relative to its current value $h_{0}$ and the density parameters of the universe for matter $\\Omega_{m}$, Dark Matter $\\Omega_{DM}$, Radiation density $\\Omega_{r}$, curvature of the universe $\\Omega_{\\kappa}$ and dark Energy $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ as  \n", "\n", "$\\left(\\frac{\\dot{h}}{h_0}\\right)^{2} = (\\Omega_{m} + \\Omega_{\\rm DM})a^{-3}+\\Omega_{r}a^{-4} + \\Omega_{\\kappa} a^{-2} + \\Omega_{\\Lambda}$\n", "\n", "Here, the parameter $a$ is the scale parameter of the universe. This is often referred to as the cosmic scale. The way to think about this is that this is the average distance between all the galaxies in the universe at any period of time in the uiverse. When the big bang happened the scale $a\\rightarrow0$ or in otherwords all the galaxies are next to each other. As the universe expands a gets larger and at some point $a\\rightarrow\\infty$ or if the universe collapses back in on itself in phenomenon known as the big crunch $a$ would actually tend towards 0 again. To make life simple, we tend to take $a=1$ for our current period of time. What this means is we are choosing our units conveniently so that this distance is 1 now in our galactic equation. At our time we also have that Hubble's constant $h$, which varies with the age of the universe thus becomes $h_{0}$. As a result, we can write the above equation as \n", "\n", "$$1 = (\\Omega_{m} + \\Omega_{\\rm DM})+\\Omega_{r}+ \\Omega_{\\kappa} + \\Omega_{\\Lambda}$$\n", "\n", "Now, we can further simply this by our knowledge of the universe $\\Omega_{r}$ is the density from radiation. We don't see a huge amount of radiation appearing in our current universe, so we can set $\\Omega_{r}=0$. In reality, we can actually test this. To make life simpler, we can really separate $\\Omega_{m}$ from $\\Omega_{\\rm DM}$, so let's call this $\\Omega_{M}$. Finally, for now let's set $\\Omega_{\\kappa}=0$. You will investigate this later. \n", "\n", "This gives us the following equation: \n", "\n", "$$1 = \\Omega_{M}+ \\Omega_{\\Lambda} {\\rm  ~or~ } \\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 1- \\Omega_{M}$$  \n", "\n", "and furthermore, we can rewrite the above equation as \n", "\n", "$$\\left(\\frac{\\dot{h}}{h_0}\\right)^{2} = (\\Omega_{M})a^{-3} + 1-\\Omega_{M}$$\n", "\n", "So at this point you might be asking what does this have to do with our data, which is distance versus redhift. While it turns out we can define both distance and redshift by parameters in the above equation. First, let's define distance. What we are looking for is the distance that light travels to a galaxy far away. As we go further in distance, we go earlier in the universe. So if we know the age of the universe $t$ relative to our current time, we know that the light travelled $d=ct$. Anyway, let's derive $t$ as a function of our scale parameter $a$ to see how it evolves. If its not exactly clear what is going on, just wait. \n", "\n", "Hubbles constant $h$ is a measure of the rate of expansion of the universe.

Redshift is how much light got stretched compared to the present day. As the universe expands, it also stretches light outwars. Thats because light moving in an expanding medium will stretch out. The redshift is thus proportional to our scale parameter $a$. Since the redshift is currently $0$ and proportional to $a$ we have that for $a=1$ $z=0$, and for $a\\rightarrow0$ $z\\rightarrow\\infty$ or $z\\propto 1/a$, this allows us to immediatly write the value for $z$ as below\n", "\n", "$$z = \\frac{1}{a}-1$$\n", "\n", "Likewise\n", "\n", "$$a=\\frac{1}{1+z}$$\n", "\n", "this finally gives us a function $d(z)$\n", "\n", "$$ d(z) = ct = \\frac{c}{h_{0}}\\int_{0}^{z} \\frac{dz^{\\prime}}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_{M}(1+z^{\\prime})^{3} + 1-\\Omega_{M}}}$$\n", "\n", "Where now we have finally put bounds on the integral to correspond to the actual value of $z$ we are choosing.
